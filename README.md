# Kitty-Split-Prototype

A database design and application for managing expense groups.

## Features

### 1. Create a Kitty (Expense Group)
- **Description:** Handles the creation of a new Kitty, capturing essential data and storing the details in the database.

### 2. Navigation Between Kitties and User Login
- **Description:** Enables navigation between different Kitties and facilitates user login. Marks the selected user as "seen" in the Users table upon login to track user engagement.

### 3. Add Transactions to a Kitty
- **Description:** Manages adding various transactions to a Kitty, accommodating different transaction types and splitting methods. Each transaction is associated with a label (Expense, Money Given, etc.), and the splitting function determines the number of rows entered in the transaction table. Includes an option to upgrade the Kitty to a "Super Kitty" (reflected in the Super Kitty column in the Kitty table).

### 4. Leave Comments in the Group
- **Description:** Allows users to leave comments within a Kitty group.

### 5. Display Expenses, Comments, Overview
- **Description:** Presents expenses, comments, and a financial overview of the Kitty. Provides insights into financial transactions, user interactions, and a summary of the Kitty's financial state.
